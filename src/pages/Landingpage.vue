  <h3>I'm a Fullstack Developer who likes Frontends:)</h3>
  <p>
    I’ve recently finished the academic program for Webdevelopment at
    FH Technikum Vienna. I have most experience in frontend development and
    strong design background due to my previous experiences. I prefer working
    with Vue.js as a Framework. Basically I'm learning constantly - recently
    I’m improving my backend skills and learning Svelte Kit. 
    <h3>What I am looking
    for...</h3><p> I'm looking for a Junior Frontend Position with professional
    development prospects in which I’ll be able to work with latest
    technologies and improve my skills constantly. My biggest motivation is
    the joy I feel during the process while researching, troubleshooting and
    and get the projects running which is incomparable to most of other
    Positons.</p>
